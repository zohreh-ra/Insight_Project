## Feedalyzer:
Make your Feedback Count!


## What is Feedalyzer?
Feedalyzer is a feedback analyzer tool to predict the quality and tone of teachers' feedback on students' reflections. 
I partnered with consulting company Sown-To-Grow (STG) to build a feedback analyzer tool for them. STG has an online platform for students where they can set goals, reflect on their goals, and get feedback from teachers. Feedback coming from teachers Brings awareness to the process of learning and strategies taken by students. Academic feedback is an essential part of effective learning and is consistently related to achievement compared to any other teaching behaviour. Effective feedback gives students guidance on improving their learning experience through self-evaluation and adjustment. It can support student enthusiasm for learning, retention, and even transition to higher education. 
However, providing feedback requires much skill by teachers and can have positive or negative impact on achievement depending on how it is given.
This product is an interactive web-app for teachers to analyze the quality and tone of their feedback to help them improve their teaching skills.


## Feedalyzer Web app
Users input their feedback and the app will detect the quality of their feedback(if it is an specific or a vague feedback) and will report on the sentiment score of their feedback (how positive, neautral, or negative their tone is).
